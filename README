# My Micro Dream Experience

I want my services to be language agnostic and have SDKs for all major languages

I want to call other services like I would any another package

I want to write APIs and know they're available in every way the client could dream of

I want to require a dependancy in my service and have it immediately available and configured for my environment

I want a seamless experience for the clients of my public API, with auto-generated docs and versioned client libraries

I want async messaging to be a first class citizen just like async / rpc is

I want to manage workspaces at a top level (e.g. xcproject and xcworkspace for Obj-C)

I want to use a mono-repo to encapsulate all of my services

I don't want non-master branches to impact users, but I want to be able to call via the API them by setting a flag

I want services to be so simple that I don't need to use templates

I want configuration to be at a workspace level when it is common to more than one service

I want my configuration to be language agnostic
